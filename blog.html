	I love reading since childhood such that my most favourite corner in the town was Hiệu sách Nhân dân Huyện (People's Bookstore). I even dreamed that the bookstore owners were my relatives such that they allow me to visit them often and to read their books for free. Haha. Then my dream came true in a different guise when I was in grade 8. A library at the local post office opened for the public. As it located just across the paddy field behind my home, I often tried to finish homework early so as that I had enough time to visit the small library before they closed at 5pm and I indulged myself an hour reading there. Bye the village library, I moved to the city for high school 2 years later. When I first entered the Da Nang Bookstore (arguably the largest in the city, multi-storey building with endlessly long aisles of books in display area) I amazed in awe like an astronaut flying in the miraculous galaxy of books. Such a giant bookstore!

	<br />
	Now, in the abundance of Singapore where you can find every bestselling book, I sometime question myself where I can find my childhood passion again..
